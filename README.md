## Web Dictionaries

This is a read helper dictionary. I create those scripts to help me with my reading. Sometimes open the browser and look for the words distractme a lot, so I dicide to create those scripts to use them when I reading to get the meanings. 

There are two main groups, firts, `Diccionario`. These directory contains:

1. Diccionario
  - Manage all the scripts
2. Ingles
  - It was very difficult to retrieve the data as I want using bash tools, so I dicide to use python to get the retrieve the data.
3. Espa√±ol
4. Portugues

The other group it's ReadLoud. It needs [gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/). This script read the selection.

By now, I'm just thinking of using those scripts in Gnome. Maybe later, I will produce something that can be used on other systems using Qt6.
